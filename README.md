# CSS Octopus Grid Layout

## Overview

This lab you will add column structure to the ORPS web page by creating your own custom CSS grid system. Use the mockup.jpg image as a reference of what your finished page should look like. Also make full use of the browsers developer tools to inspect elements and highlight elements to identify which grid classes to apply to which elements.

## Directions

1. First, open the mockup.jpg file as a reference to what the finished site page should look like.
2. Then open the index.html file in your browser. It will appear as a single column layout initially.
3. Next, open index.html and css/grid.css in your code editor. 
4. In css/grid.css file write the CSS necessary to create container, row, and column classes need for your grid. use the comments in this follow to lead you to the correct solution.
5. Finally in the index.html file apply the grid classes you created to the elements as so:
    a. Add container classes to header, main, and footer elements.
    b. Add row classes to all divs wrapping sections that are grouping sections that will become columns in the same row together.
    c. Add the corresponding column classes to each section to set their appropriate width and column behavior so they display side by side.
6. You can check your code by refreshing the index page in the browser. Once your page looks the same or close to the mockup.jpg image, your all done! To troubleshoot, don't forget you can validate your HTML and CSS code at:
